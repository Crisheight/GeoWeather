# GeoWeather
Geolocation-based Weather Page

IMPORTANT:

Get your openweatherAPI key and place it where {APPID} is, removing the {}. This will make it work.

**There is a cors proxy so that you can check it locally before you link it to a live site. To make it work open up the link to cors first and request access. This is for cross-origin checks. If you do not need this, delete reference to cors and the proxy.**

-- Please be careful with your API keys, use dotenv framework if needed --
